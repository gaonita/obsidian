this can be really fun. my second attempt to use obsidian. I am now more a developer than few years ago. added some plugins and even connected it to git repository. 
a lot to learn and do to be familiar with this! but it feels like it's a great way to improve my productivity. I can even use [[Vim]] commands :)
